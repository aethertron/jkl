I made a maze game for Ludum Dare 26. The theme was 'minimalism'. My entry is unpolished and not impressive at all. But I'm glad it's done. First finished game in years.

It was a good opportunity to introduce myself to Impact JS, a sweet HTML5/JavaScript game engine. It comes with lots of standard features, like a 2D map editor and simple physics. It handles collisions out of the box. Looks like it'll be good for rapid prototyping, when I learn the main features. Then I'll be able to make some decent complete 2D games.

It can also export to iOS. The Windows 8 store lets you sell HTML5 programs. So I might recoup my license costs by using this engine directly.
